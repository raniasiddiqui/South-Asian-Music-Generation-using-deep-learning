# South-Asian-Music-Generation-using-deep-learning
The motivation behind this project was to raise awareness around south asian music, inspire people to create music inspired by south asian sounds, and promote south asian instruments like sitar, tabla and bansuri.
Given south asian musical notes and frequencies, we generated a new sequence of notes in a similar style of music.
* Our dataset consisted of 12 hours of youtube audio that was converted into mp3 format first, then converted into WAV, and then finally converted into midi format.
* The models that were used were 1D CNN(convulational neural network) and LSTM
